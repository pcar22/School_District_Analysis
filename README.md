The result of how the district summary was affected shows that very little has changed. The percentages were rounded in the original analysis, and we see less than 1% change in the overall percentage. The second image shows the decimal left in the percentage.

Thomas High School is a medium size school and we can see the change has little affect. The top image is the original analysis, and the bottom is after the change has been made. I have left in the added decimals to show how little this change affected the overall percentages.
